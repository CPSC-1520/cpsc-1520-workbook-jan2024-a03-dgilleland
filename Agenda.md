> To grab a starting point for the demo, you can use [**tiged**](https://github.com/tiged/tiged) (based on [`degit`](https://github.com/Rich-Harris/degit) by Rich Harris, creator of Svelte) to grab a copy of the demo folder from my workbook. Note that you will need to have `pnpm` installed and working on your computer. Run the following code in the terminal from the root of your repository:
> 
> ```bash
> pnpm dlx tiged --disable-cache --force CPSC-1520/CPSC-1520-Workbook-A02-dgilleland/src/008/demo-events ./src/008/demo-events
> ```
>
> ***Note:** You may need to <kbd>ctrl</kbd>+<kbd>c</kbd> to stop the `pnpm tlx tiged` command after it has finished downloading the demo folder.*
