# Playing Cards

> This project uses the png/svg playing cards from this [Google Code archive](https://code.google.com/archive/p/vector-playing-cards/downloads). These image resources are released into the public domain.

Here, we'll explore generating a class that represents a playing card. We'll create a deck of cards and shuffle them. Then, we'll deal out the cards into two piles for two players (the standard setup for the game of *War*).

## Creating the Classes

We'll be creating two classes: `PlayingCard` and `DeckOfCards`. (*See the [MDN docs on Classes](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Classes)*).
