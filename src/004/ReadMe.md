# JavaScript in Your WebPage

The following is a short-list of the topics covered in this demo.

- console.log
- `<script ...>` attributes of `src`, `module` and `defer`, along with "inline" scripts
- live server extension for VS Code
- variable declarations, types, math

## Discover Emmet  ![Code](https://img.shields.io/badge/Code%20Status-Walkthrough-blueviolet?logo=Visual%20Studio%20Code&labelColor=indigo)

This walkthrough introduces **Emmet**. It also contains two small JavaScript files: [`first.js`](./first.js) and [`second.js`](./second.js). Here, we will explore the effect of including these in the `<head>` of an HTML document that we will generate using *Emmet*.

Loading external JavaScript files is accomplished through the `<script>` element's `src` attribute. JavaScript code can be included in the HTML directly by being placed in the `<script>` element directly, but larger scripts are typically kept separate from the HTML in their own files. They standard file extension for JavaScript files is `.js`.

1. Create an `Index.html` file in this folder. Add a basic html document using [Emmet](https://code.visualstudio.com/docs/editor/emmet) by typing `html:5` and selecting the Emmet-generated expansion.

1. Add some basic content to the page using Emmet:

    ```
    h1{Emmet for HTML/JS/CSS}+ul>li{Item $}*3^p*3>lorem
    ```

1. In the `<head>` element of the page, add the following markup.

    ```html
    <script src="first.js"></script>
    <script src="second.js" type="module" defer></script>
    ```

1. View the page in the browser by launching it using Live Server. Right-click on the file and choose "Open with Live Server".

> *:+1: **TIP:** It's usually a good idea to use relative paths when linking your HTML to JavaScript files. This makes it easier to move sets of files around without having to change the internal code.*

## Software Design ![Docs](https://img.shields.io/badge/Documentation%20Status-100%25%20Complete-brightgreen?logo=Read%20the%20Docs)

"Tight coupling" makes for bad design, because changes in either area can potentially "break" the other areas.

"Loose coupling" between the areas of Content, Presentation, and Functionality makes for a flexible design that is easy to maintain.

This is not to say that content, presentation and functionality have no reference to each other. It's just that we want the connections between them to be ["unobtrusive"](https://dictionary.cambridge.org/dictionary/english/unobtrusive). In the case of web pages, it's the browser's job to bring together HTML, CSS and JavaScript files; this happens in the rendering process for the page.
