- [x] Define the term "truthiness" as it relates to JavaScript
  - "truthiness" is a term used to describe the "truth-like" value of a variable. In JavaScript, the following values are considered "falsey":
    - `false`
    - `0`
    - `""` (empty string)
    - `null`
    - `undefined`
    - `NaN`
- [x] Describe the general syntax of if-else statements in JavaScript

  ```js
  if(conditionalExpression)
      statementOrStatementBlock
  else
      statementOrStatementBlock
  ```

  - When using statement blocks, the placement of curly braces is different than what you might be used to in C#.

  ```js
  if(conditionalExpression) {
      // zero or more statements
  } else {
      // zero or more statements
  }
  ```

- [x] List and describe the purpose of the relational and equality operators in javaScript
- [x] Describe what is meant by a "conditional expression"
  - A conditional expression is an expression that will result in a `true` or `false` value.
- [x] List the operator precedence for mixing logical, arithmetic, and relational operations
- [x] List the [relational operators](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Operators#relational_operators)
- [x] List the [logical operators](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Operators#binary_logical_operators)
- [ ] Use relational, logical, and arithmetic operators to construct conditional expressions
- [ ] Demonstrate an understanding of operator precedence in conditional expressions
- [ ] Use statement blocks to allow nesting program statements into control structures
- [x] Define the term "boundary condition" as it relates to if-else statements and testing
