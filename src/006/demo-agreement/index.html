        <ol>
          <li>
            In consideration of the disclosure of Proprietary Information by the Disclosing Party, the Receiving Party
            hereby agrees: (i) to hold the Proprietary Information in strict confidence and to take all reasonable
            precautions to protect such Proprietary Information (including, without limitation, all precautions the
            Receiving Party employs with respect to its own confidential materials), (ii) not to disclose any such
            Proprietary Information or any information derived therefrom to any third person, (iii) not to make any use
            whatsoever at any time of such Proprietary Information except to evaluate internally its relationship with
            the Disclosing Party, and (iv) not to copy or reverse engineer any such Proprietary Information. The
            Receiving Party shall procure that its employees, agents and sub-contractors to whom Proprietary Information
            is disclosed or who have access to Proprietary Information sign a nondisclosure or similar agreement in
            content substantially similar to this Agreement
          </li>
          <li>
            Without granting any right or license, the Disclosing Party agrees that the foregoing shall not apply with
            respect to any information after five years following the disclosure thereof or any information that the
            Receiving Party can document (i) is or becomes (through no improper action or inaction by the Receiving
            Party or any affiliate, agent, consultant or employee) generally available to the public, or (ii) was in its
            possession or known by it prior to receipt from the Disclosing Party as evidenced in writing, except to the
            extent that such information was unlawfully appropriated, or (iii) was rightfully disclosed to it by a third
            party, or (iv) was independently developed without use of any Proprietary Information of the Disclosing
            Party. The Receiving Party may make disclosures required by law or court order provided the Receiving Party
            uses diligent reasonable efforts to limit disclosure and has allowed the Disclosing Party to seek a
            protective order.
          </li>
          <li>
            Immediately upon the written request by the Disclosing Party at any time, the Receiving Party will return to
            the Disclosing Party all Proprietary Information and all documents or media containing any such Proprietary
            Information and any and all copies or extracts thereof, save that where such Proprietary Information is a
            form incapable of return or has been copied or transcribed into another document, it shall be destroyed or
            erased, as appropriate.
          </li>
          <li>
            The Receiving Party understands that nothing herein (i) requires the disclosure of any Proprietary
            Information or (ii) requires the Disclosing Party to proceed with any transaction or relationship.
          </li>
          <li>
            The Receiving Party further acknowledges and agrees that no representation or warranty, express or implied,
            is or will be made, and no responsibility or liability is or will be accepted by the Disclosing Party, or by
            any of its respective directors, officers, employees, agents or advisers, as to, or in relation to, the
            accuracy of completeness of any Proprietary Information made available to the Receiving Party or its
            advisers; it is responsible for making its own evaluation of such Proprietary Information.
          </li>
          <li>
            The failure of either party to enforce its rights under this Agreement at any time for any period shall not
            be construed as a waiver of such rights. If any part, term or provision of this Agreement is held to be
            illegal or unenforceable neither the validity, nor enforceability of the remainder of this Agreement shall
            be affected. Neither Party shall assign or transfer all or any part of its rights under this Agreement
            without the consent of the other Party. This Agreement may not be amended for any other reason without the
            prior written agreement of both Parties. This Agreement constitutes the entire understanding between the
            Parties relating to the subject matter hereof unless any representation or warranty made about this
            Agreement was made fraudulently and, save as may be expressly referred to or referenced herein, supersedes
            all prior representations, writings, negotiations or understandings with respect hereto.
          </li>
          <li>
            This Agreement shall be governed by the laws of the jurisdiction in which the Disclosing Party is located
            (or if the Disclosing Party is based in more than one country, the country in which its headquarters are
            located) (the "Territory") and the parties agree to submit disputes arising out of or in connection with
            this Agreement to the non-exclusive of the courts in the Territory.
