# Addendum

> There's always more to learn.

Besides getting a better understanding of the differences between [erratum, addendum and corrigendum](https://grammarist.com/usage/erratum-addendum-and-corrigendum/), there are new things to learn about CSS and HTML. One of those things is the [CSS Anchor](https://youtu.be/B4Y9Ed4lLAI?si=8ioZsa20-KWJelF6).

Why should you care about this in a course focused on JavaScript? Because it turns out that this simple HTML/CSS feature eliminates something we could only do with JavaScript in the past: repositioning elements on page resize.
