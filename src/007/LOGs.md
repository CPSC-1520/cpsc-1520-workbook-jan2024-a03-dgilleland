# Creating JavaScript Functions (LOGs)

*At the end of this lesson, you should be able to...*

- [ ] Identify and distinguish the various ways to declare a function
  - *See this [Chat GPT discussion](https://chat.openai.com/share/da57cfba-9ece-4c5d-a48b-66e374211c9c) for an explanation.*
- [ ] Describe the essential parts of a function declaration
  - A function declaration must have a parameter list (even if it is empty) and a function body (even if it is empty). The other parts will depend on the way the function is being declared.
- [ ] Describe what is meant by a **function signature**
  - Typically, in languages like C#, a function signature is the combination of the name of the function and its parameter list. Languages which use that definition often allow something called *function overloading*.
  - JavaScript only regards the *name* of the function as its signiture; function overloading is not possible in JavaScript (largely because it plays "fast and loose" with the parameters, because it allows us to use as many or as few arguments when calling the function).
- [ ] Describe what is meant by the term **function body**
- [ ] Define the term [**Block-statement**](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Statements/block)
- [ ] Define the term **parameter**
- [ ] Define the term **argument**
- [ ] Define the term **scope**
- [ ] Distinguish between local scope and global scope
- [ ] Describe how local scope "hides" a variable declared inside a function
- [ ] Define the term **lifetime**
- [ ] Distinguish between the lifetime of a variable and the scope of a variable
  - The difference between the lifetime of a variable and the scope of a variable is that the lifetime of a variable is how long it exists in memory, whereas the scope of a variable is where it can be accessed in the code.
- [ ] Discuss some of the peculiarities of calling functions in JavaScript as compared to other languages such as C#
- [ ] Create functions that return a value
- [ ] Create functions that don't return a value
- [ ] Display a function in the developer tool's console window
- [ ] Explain the concept of "hoisting" in JavaScript
- [ ] Explain the benefits of declaring functions as constants in JavaScript
  - When you make your variable a constant (as in `const myFunction = function() { ... }`), you are making it read-only. This means that you can't accidentally overwrite it later in your code.
- [ ] Describe what is meant by the term "refactoring"
  - Taking code that already works and "cleaning it up" to make it more readable, more efficient, and/or more maintainable. This does not change the functionality of the code (it should still do the same job).
