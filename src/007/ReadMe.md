# Creating JavaScript Functions ![Code](https://img.shields.io/badge/Code%20Status-Walkthrough-blueviolet?logo=Visual%20Studio%20Code&labelColor=indigo)  ![Docs](https://img.shields.io/badge/Documentation%20Status-10--40%25%20Rough%20Outline-red?logo=Read%20the%20Docs)

## Demo-Greet

- Declaring functions
  - Parameters and return values
  - Named functions
  - Anonymous functions
  - assigning a function to a variable
    - use `const`
- Calling functions
  - arguments
- Function Scope
  - `let` vs `var` vs *failing to declare a variable*
  - The ability to see variables ***outside*** the function
- [ ] Create a function to get a description of the image from the user and then set the `alt` attribute of the image to that description.
- [ ] Call that function from the console in the dev tools. Then inspect the element to see if the `alt` attribute was set correctly.
- [ ] Add the function call to the script `main.js`.
  - [ ] Does it matter if the call to the function occurs before or after the function declaration?

## Practice Agreement

- "Refactoring" refers to the process of improving the code without changing the functionality.
- See the instructions in the [starter-kit](./practice-agreement/README.md)
  - [ ] Move the instructions from the JavaScript file to the ReadMe file.
