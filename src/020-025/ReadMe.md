# Topic Fast-Track

This demo is a fast-track for a suite of upcoming topics on the DOM API with Timers/Intervals. It blends in the usage of the Fetch API to capture and process JSON. All of this is done in a Node project based on Vite.

## Background

This demo was set up as a Vanilla Vite project using JavaScript.

```ps
pnpm create vite@latest
```

Then, the existing boiler-plate code in the project was stripped down to have our more "traditional" HTML/JavaScript setup. The HTML page presented is based off of the 3rd-party source for our JSON data: [RandomUser.md](https://randomuser.me).
